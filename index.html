                 <h2>Introduction to critical thinking</h2>
                 <p class="long-copy">
                     One of the most important aspects of academic work is the ability to think critically about what you read, what you write and what you are told. Rather than accept all information as truth, you need to test the validity of others’ standpoints in order to arrive at your own point of view.
                 </p>

                 <p class="long-copy">

                     When you think critically, you are being active; you are not passively accepting everything you read and hear, but questioning, evaluating, making judgements, finding connections and categorising. Critical thinking is necessary in order to form judgements in lectures and tutorials; when reading and when writing assignments.

                     You will find information on how to apply critical thinking to your tasks at university in this section.
                 </p>

                     If you would like further information, please contact staff from the Academic Language and Learning Success Program (ALLSP), who run free workshops for internal and external students on all academic skills.

                 <p class="container">
                     Weighing up alternatives in order to make decisions is part of the critical thinking process. For example, think about the  following activities and ask yourself what strategies you would use to come to a decision.

                 <h2>What does critical thinking involve</h2>
                 <p class="container">
                     Critical thinking involves active involvement. You are not passively accepting everything that you read or hear but are questioning, evaluating, categorising information and making connections within the text and comparing what the author is saying with other experts who have written on the same topic.

                 <p class="container">
                     One of the key strategies you can use when reading critically is to ask yourself a series of questions. Begin by asking questions which relate to the text overall and then look at the author’s argument and the evidence used to support it.
